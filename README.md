### About Me :

My name is Bing En, and I am currently a third-year IT student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">. As a student, my motivation is unwavering when it comes to achieving my goals in the field of IT. My primary aspiration is to become an Application & Web Developer, with a special focus on mastering UI development. Concurrently, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of evolving into a Full-stack Developer, adept in both Frontend and Backend development.

I consider myself as a type of person who never likes to rely on luck. I firmly believe that everything can be achieved through hard work and determination. I seek to perform my best in every occasion, not to impress any, but rather to strive for excellence. Not to mention, when handling difficult situations, many might see as problems, I simply look at them as surmoutable challenges that set my mind in overdrive mode. I possess various soft skills such as communication, teamwork and leadership. Alongside these, I am proficient in both English and Chinese languages. Moreover, I have acquired foundational knowledge in programming language etc. Python, C#, Java and how to handle Power BI software, Adobe Illustrator, Android Studio, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, GameMaker, GitHub and many more.

Apart from academics, I relish playing badminton and swimming, both for leisure and competition. My passion extends to UX/UI development and coding websites, with a particular dedication to mastering UI development during my free time. With a profound interest in application and web development, I eagerly anticipate delving deeper into this realm in the years to come. You're welcome to explore further insights about me on my personal website.
